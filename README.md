# Morphogen-DAU-Model: Diffusion-Adsorption-Uptake Model for Morphogen Validation

## üî¨ Project Overview

This repository presents the **Diffusion-Adsorption-Uptake (DAU) Model**, a rigorous theoretical and computational framework designed to efficiently analyze and validate whether a target protein fulfills the core properties of a **Morphogen**.

The validation of a morphogen is fundamentally governed by two core hypotheses:

1.  **Hypothesis 1 (H1: Gradient Formation)**: The protein must establish a stable, spatial concentration gradient across the tissue.
2.  **Hypothesis 2 (H2: Concentration-Dependent Regulation)**: Cells must respond to this concentration gradient in a dosage-dependent manner, activating distinct gene expression profiles in different concentration zones to specify cell fate.

The DAU Model is strictly derived from first-principle physics and higher mathematics, providing a necessary, minimal coarse-graining of the dynamics. It describes the key processes of **Diffusion ($D$)**, **Adsorption/Binding ($K$)**, and **Cellular Uptake/Degradation ($k_{\text{uptake}}$)** of the morphogen within an embryonic tissue, enabling efficient quantification and prediction of its kinetic parameters from experimental data.

To provide an intuitive understanding of the model's components and processes, the DAU model schematic is included below.

## üìú Core Model Derivation

### 1. The Governing Partial Differential Equation (PDE)

Considering a 1D spatial domain ($x \in [0, L]$), the dynamic change in morphogen concentration $C(x, t)$ is governed by the following PDE:

$$
(1 + K) \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} - k_{\text{uptake}} C
$$

Where:
* $C(x, t)$: Morphogen concentration at position $x$ and time $t$.
* $D$: The effective diffusion coefficient of the morphogen in the extracellular space.
* $K$: The **binding constant** (dimensionless) for non-endocytic binding of soluble morphogen to the extracellular matrix or cell surface.
* $k_{\text{uptake}}$: The **first-order rate constant** for endocytosis or degradation.
* The $(1+K)$ term: Accounts for the **buffering effect** of the surface/matrix-bound pool, effectively defining the **effective diffusivity** $D_{\text{eff}} = \frac{D}{1+K}$.

### 2. The Steady-State Analytical Solution for H1 (The Gradient)

When the system reaches a steady state ($\partial C / \partial t = 0$), the PDE simplifies to an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE):

$$
D \frac{d^2 C}{d x^2} - k_{\text{uptake}} C = 0
$$

**Detailed Derivation:**

Rearranging the ODE:
$$
\frac{d^2 C}{d x^2} = \frac{k_{\text{uptake}}}{D_{\text{eff}}} C = \mu^2 C
$$
Where the **characteristic decay parameter** $\mu$ is defined as:
$$
\mu = \sqrt{\frac{k_{\text{uptake}}}{D_{\text{eff}}}}
$$

The general solution is in the form:
$$
C(x) = A \cosh(\mu x) + B \sinh(\mu x)
$$

Applying Boundary Conditions:
* **Source Boundary (at $x=0$)**: $C(0) = C_0$ (Constant release concentration)
* **Far-End Boundary (at $x=L$)**: $C(L) = 0$ (Zero concentration/perfect sink)

1.  Substituting $C(0) = C_0$:
    $$
    C_0 = A \cosh(0) + B \sinh(0) \implies A = C_0
    $$

2.  Substituting $C(L) = 0$:
    $$
    0 = C_0 \cosh(\mu L) + B \sinh(\mu L) \implies B = -C_0 \frac{\cosh(\mu L)}{\sinh(\mu L)}
    $$

The final steady-state analytical solution (rearranged for clarity) is:

$$
C_{\text{steady}}(x) = C_0 \frac{\sinh \left( \mu (L-x) \right)}{\sinh \left( \mu L \right)}
$$

The **Characteristic Decay Length ($\lambda$)** of the morphogen gradient is $\lambda = 1/\mu$, quantifying the spatial extent of the gradient.
