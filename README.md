# Morphogen-DAU-Model: Diffusion-Adsorption-Uptake Model for Morphogen Validation

## üî¨ Project Overview

This repository presents the **Diffusion-Adsorption-Uptake (DAU) Model**, a rigorous theoretical and computational framework designed to efficiently analyze and validate whether a target protein fulfills the core properties of a **Morphogen**.

The validation of a morphogen is fundamentally governed by two core hypotheses:

1.  **Hypothesis 1 (H1: Gradient Formation)**: The protein must establish a stable, spatial concentration gradient across the tissue.
2.  **Hypothesis 2 (H2: Concentration-Dependent Regulation)**: Cells must respond to this concentration gradient in a dosage-dependent manner, activating distinct gene expression profiles in different concentration zones to specify cell fate.

The DAU Model is strictly derived from first-principle physics and higher mathematics, providing a necessary, minimal coarse-graining of the dynamics. It describes the key processes of **Diffusion ($D$)**, **Adsorption/Binding ($K$)**, and **Cellular Uptake/Degradation ($k_{\text{uptake}}$)** of the morphogen within an embryonic tissue, enabling efficient quantification and prediction of its kinetic parameters from experimental data.

## üìú Core Model Derivation

### 1. The Governing Partial Differential Equation (PDE)

Considering a 1D spatial domain ($x \in [0, L]$), the dynamic change in morphogen concentration $C(x, t)$ is governed by the following PDE (Partial Differential Equation):

$$
(1 + K) \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} - k_{\text{uptake}} C
$$

Where:
* $C(x, t)$: Morphogen concentration.
* $D$: The effective diffusion coefficient.
* $K$: The **binding constant** (dimensionless).
* $k_{\text{uptake}}$: The **first-order rate constant** for uptake/degradation.
* The $(1+K)$ term implies the **effective diffusivity** is $D_{\text{eff}} = D / (1+K)$.

### 2. The Steady-State Analytical Solution for H1 (The Gradient)

When the system reaches a steady state ($\partial C / \partial t = 0$), the PDE simplifies to an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE):

$$
D \frac{d^2 C}{d x^2} - k_{\text{uptake}} C = 0
$$

**Detailed Derivation & Solution:**

The ODE can be written as $\frac{d^2 C}{d x^2} = \mu^2 C$, where the **characteristic decay parameter** $\mu$ is defined as:

$$
\mu = \sqrt{\frac{k_{\text{uptake}}}{D_{\text{eff}}}}
$$

Applying the boundary conditions ($C(0) = C_0$ and $C(L) = 0$), the final steady-state analytical solution is:

$$
C_{\text{steady}}(x) = C_0 \frac{\sinh \left( \mu (L-x) \right)}{\sinh \left( \mu L \right)}
$$

The **Characteristic Decay Length ($\lambda$)** of the morphogen gradient is $\lambda = 1/\mu$.
